## Game Concept

Railgun is a top-down, rouge-like, bullet hell game where the player has died and wakes up on a train heading to hell. The player is given a gun by one of the employees, and is tasked with reaching the front of the train and defeating the conductor. However, there is a catch. As soon as the player takes the gun, it fuses with their life force. Reloading the gun costs health, which encourages being careful with your shots, as you have limited ammo before needing to reload.

## Project Structure

This game is made in C#, using the MonoGame framework. In addition to the game, we also made an external level editor using MonoGame.Forms to facilitate the creation of levels.
